# flask-template
A basic template to get a Flask web application up and running.

This was originally the beginnings of a web app that connected personal trainers
and clients. As a result, many details like secure logins are already solved
in this repo, but it also includes a lot of superfluous stuff specific to
personal training.  
I loosely based this on <a href = "https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog">
this repo by miguelgrinberg</a> after reading his flask mega tutorial, which
I highly recommend.
